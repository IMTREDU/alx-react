By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to set up Webpack for a basic project
- Entry points, output, and loaders
- How to add and configure plugins
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- Setting up a development server

## Environment

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node.js: 12.x.x
- Editor: VS Code / Vim / Emacs
- All files end with a new line

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Basic Setup

### Task 3: Dev Server & Code Splitting

- Folder: `task_3`
- Set up `webpack-dev-server` on port 8564
- Split code into modules (`header`, `body`, `footer`)
- Use separate entry points and generate bundles for each
- Use plugins: `HtmlWebpackPlugin`, `CleanWebpackPlugin`
- Enable source maps for better debugging
- Enable code splitting to reduce bundle size

## Running the Project

From any task directory:

```bash
npm install       # Install dependencies
npm run build     # Build production bundle
npm run start-dev # Start dev server (task_3 only)
